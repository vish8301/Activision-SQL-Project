## Overview
This project demonstrates advanced data analytics skills in the gaming domain, inspired by a job posting from Activision. It uses data from Kaggle and the Steam API to analyze trends in gaming, especially focusing on the Call of Duty series. This analysis is meant to showcase skills relevant for a potential analytics role at Activision.

## Data Sources
- **Kaggle:** To obtain historical videgame sales data.
- **Steam API:** Used to extract data related to games by Activision, providing insights into trends and statistics.

## Methodology
**Data Collection:** Gathered data from Kaggle and the Steam API.
**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Prepared the data for analysis by cleaning and structuring it using Python.
**SQL Analysis:** Primary analysis was conducted using SQL to investigate and manipulate the data efficiently.

## Conclusion
The job posting is for an Analytics Internship at Activision Blizzard, Inc., where interns will work on meaningful projects and gain valuable experience. The SQL analysis of the data provided key insights into the Call of Duty franchise, regional preferences, and gaming platform trends.

Key findings include the top-rated Call of Duty games, the strong preference for Call of Duty games in North American and European markets, and the popularity of different platforms, with a shift towards PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The analysis also identified discrepancies between popular and highest-selling games on Steam.

Based on these insights, recommendations include focusing on successful elements from top-rated games, addressing shortcomings in games with lower positive review percentages, and investing in the Call of Duty franchise by prioritizing user feedback and market trends. Activision should also explore opportunities to expand its market share in regions with lower Call of Duty popularity and conduct further analysis on Steam's popular games. Finally, the company should focus on developing games for newer platforms, tailoring marketing campaigns, and optimizing game features for PlayStation platforms.
